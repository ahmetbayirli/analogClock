# Analog Clock Task

Requirements:

Create a UI component to display an analog clock similar to the above screen shot, using any of the common JavaScript frameworks such as ReactJS, VueJS or angular.

Use latest EcmaScript or Typescript.

Use SVG or Canvas to render the clock face.

The component should have a property to optionally show or hide the seconds hand – secondsHandVisible = true | false.

The clock should update every second if the seconds hand is visible, or every minute if the seconds hand is not visible.

The clock face would paint with a light (white) background if the time is between 8AM – 5PM

Create a simple web page index.html that would reference the component and render it.   show a checkbox to set the secondsHandsVisible to turn on the red seconds hand on/off.
